     abstract = {Exciton-polariton condensation in direct bandgap semiconductors strongly coupled to light enables a broad range of fundamental studies and applications like low-threshold and electrically driven lasing. Yet, materials hosting exciton-polariton condensation in ambient conditions are rare, with fabrication protocols that are often inefficient and non-scalable. Here, room-temperature exciton-polariton condensation and lasing is observed in a microcavity with embedded formamidiniumlead bromide (FAPbBr3) perovskite film. This optically active material is spin-coated onto the microcavity mirror, which makes the whole device scalable up to large lateral sizes. The sub-μm granulation of the polycrystalline FAPbBr3 film allows for observation of polariton lasing in a single quantum-confined mode of a polaritonic 'quantum dot'. Compared to random photon lasing, observed in bare FAPbBr3 films, polariton lasing exhibits a lower threshold, narrower linewidth, and an order of magnitude longer coherence time. Both polariton and random photon lasing are observed under the conditions of pulsed optical pumping, and persist without significant degradation for up to 6 and 17 hours of a continuous experimental run, respectively. This study demonstrates the excellent potential of the FAPbBr3 perovskite as a new material for room-temperature polaritonics, with the added value of efficient and scalable fabrication offered by the solution-based spin-coating process.}

     abstract = {The emergence of spatial coherence in a confined two-dimensional Bose gas of exciton-polaritons with tuneable interactions offers a unique opportunity to explore the role of interactions in a phase transition in a driven-dissipative quantum system, where both the phase transition and thermalisation are mediated by interactions. We investigate, experimentally and numerically, the phase correlations and steady-state properties of the gas over a wide range of interaction strengths by varying the photonic/excitonic fraction of the polaritons and their density. We find that the first order spatial coherence function exhibits algebraic decay consistent with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition. Surprisingly, the exponent of the algebraic decay is inversely proportional to the coherent density of polaritons, in analogy to equilibrium superfluids above the BKT transition, but with a different proportionality constant. Our work paves the way for future investigations of the phenomenon of phase transitions and superfluidity in a driven-dissipative setting.}

     abstract = {Exciton-polariton lasers are a promising source of coherent light for low-energy applications due to their low-threshold operation. However, a detailed experimental study of their spectral purity, which directly affects their coherence properties, is still missing. Here, we present a high-resolution spectroscopic investigation of the energy and linewidth of an exciton-polariton laser in the single-mode regime, which derives its coherent emission from an optically pumped and confined exciton-polariton condensate. We report an ultra-narrow linewidth of 56 MHz or 0.24 µeV, corresponding to a coherence time of 5.7 ns. The narrow linewidth is consistently achieved by using an exciton-polariton condensate with a high photonic content confined in an optically induced trap. Contrary to previous studies, we show that the excitonic reservoir created by the pump and responsible for creating the trap does not strongly affect the emission linewidth as long as the condensate is trapped and the pump power is well above the condensation (lasing) threshold. The long coherence time of the exciton-polariton system uncovered here opens up opportunities for manipulating its macroscopic quantum state, which is essential for applications in classical and quantum computing.}

     abstract = In this work, we review different generalizations of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT) in two-band non-Hermitian systems and propose a protocol for measuring them in experiments. We present the generalized QGT components, i.e., the quantum metric and Berry curvature, for a non-Hermitian hybrid photonic (exciton-polariton) system and show that the generalized non-Hermitian QGT can be constructed from experimental observables. In particular, we extend the existing method of measuring the QGT that uses the pseudospins in photonic and exciton-polariton systems by suggesting a method to construct the left eigenstates from experiments. We also show that the QGT components have clear signatures in wave-packet dynamics, where the anomalous Hall drift arises from both the non-Hermitian Berry curvature and Berry connection, suggesting that both left and right eigenstates are necessary for defining non-Hermitian band geometries and topologies.

     abstract = {We theoretically investigate the dynamics of wave packets in a generic, non-Hermitian, optically anisotropic exciton-polariton system that exhibits degeneracies of its complex-valued eigenenergies in the form of pairs of exceptional points in momentum space. We observe the self-acceleration and reshaping of the wave packets governed by their eigenenergies. We further find that the exciton-polariton wave packets tend to evolve into the eigenstate with the smaller decay rate, then propagate towards the minima of the decay rates in momentum space, resulting in directional transport in real space. We also describe the formation of pseudospin topological defects on the imaginary Fermi arc, where the decay rates of the two eigenstates coincide in momentum space. These effects of non-Hermiticity on the dynamics of exciton polaritons can be observed experimentally in a microcavity with optically anisotropic cavity spacer or exciton-hosting materials. This rich non-Hermitian dynamics can also be observed in other two-dimensional, two-band systems with similar complex band structures such as purely photonic planar microcavities, liquid crystal cavities, and non-Hermitian photonic lattices.}

Here, we show that dissipative coupling between bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) and photons in an optical microcavity can lead to the formation of exciton polaritons with an inverted dispersion of the lower polariton branch and hence, a negative mass. We perform direct measurements of the anomalous dispersion in atomically thin (monolayer) WS2 crystals embedded in planar microcavities and demonstrate that the propagation direction of the negative-mass polaritons is opposite to their momentum. Our study introduces the concept of non-Hermitian dispersion engineering for exciton polaritons and opens a pathway for realising new phases of quantum matter in a solid state.}

     abstract = {Interactions between quasiparticles are of fundamental importance and ultimately determine the macroscopic properties of quantum matter. A famous example is the phenomenon of superconductivity, which arises from attractive electron-electron interactions that are mediated by phonons or even other more exotic fluctuations in the material. Here we introduce mobile exciton impurities into a two-dimensional electron gas and investigate the interactions between the resulting Fermi polaron quasiparticles. We employ multi-dimensional coherent spectroscopy on monolayer WS2, which provides an ideal platform for determining the nature of polaron-polaron interactions due to the underlying trion fine structure and the valley specific optical selection rules. At low electron doping densities, we find that the dominant interactions are between polaron states that are dressed by the same Fermi sea. In the absence of bound polaron pairs (bipolarons), we show using a minimal microscopic model that these interactions originate from a phase-space filling effect, where excitons compete for the same electrons. We furthermore reveal the existence of a bipolaron bound state with remarkably large binding energy, involving excitons in different valleys cooperatively bound to the same electron. Our work lays the foundation for probing and understanding strong electron correlation effects in two-dimensional layered structures such as moiré superlattices.}

Many of the proposed applications rely on the ability to trap polaritons and to reach macroscopic occupation of their ground energy state. Here, we engineer a trap for room-temperature polaritons in an all-dielectric optical microcavity by locally increasing the interactions between the WS2 excitons and cavity photons. The resulting confinement enhances the population and the first-order coherence of the polaritons in the ground state, with the latter effect related to dramatic suppression of disorder-induced inhomogeneous dephasing. We also demonstrate efficient population transfer into the trap when optically injecting free polaritons outside of its periphery.}

     abstract = {Exciton polaritons in atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenide crystals (monolayer TMDCs) have emerged as a promising candidate to enable topological transport, ultra-efficient laser technologies, and collective quantum phenomena such as polariton condensation and superfluidity at room temperature. However, integrating monolayer TMDCs into high-quality planar microcavities to achieve the required strong coupling between the cavity photons and the TMDC excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) has proven challenging. Previous approaches to integration had to compromise between various adverse effects on the strength of light-matter interactions in the monolayer, the cavity photon lifetime, and the lateral size of the microcavity. Here, we demonstrate a scalable approach to fabricate high-quality planar microcavities with an integrated monolayer WS2 layer-by-layer by using polymethyl methacrylate/silicon oxide (PMMA/SiOx) as a cavity spacer. Because the exciton oscillator strength is well protected against the required processing steps by the PMMA layer, the microcavities investigated in this work, which have quality factors of above 103, can operate in the strong light-matter coupling regime at room temperature. This is an important step toward fabricating wafer-scale and patterned microcavities for engineering the exciton-polariton potential landscape, which is essential for enabling many proposed technologies.}

     abstract = {The classic Bogoliubov theory of weakly interacting Bose gases rests upon the assumption that nearly all the bosons condense into the lowest quantum state at sufficiently low temperatures. Here we develop a generalized version of Bogoliubov theory for the case of a driven-dissipative exciton-polariton condensate with a large incoherent uncondensed component, or excitonic reservoir. We argue that such a reservoir can consist of both excitonic high-momentum polaritons and optically dark superpositions of excitons across different optically active layers, such as multiple quantum wells in a microcavity. In particular, we predict interconversion between the dark and bright (light-coupled) excitonic states that can lead to a dynamical equilibrium between the condensate and reservoir populations. We show that the presence of the reservoir fundamentally modifies both the energy and the amplitudes of the Bogoliubov quasiparticle excitations due to the non-Galilean-invariant nature of polaritons. Our theoretical findings are supported by our experiment, where we directly detect the Bogoliubov excitation branches of an optically trapped polariton condensate in the high-density regime. By analyzing the measured occupations of the excitation branches, we extract the Bogoliubov amplitudes across a range of momenta and show that they agree with our generalized theory.}

     abstract = {A non-Hermitian topological invariant arising from exceptional points is directly probed in an exciton-polariton system. Topology is central to understanding and engineering materials that display robust physical phenomena immune to imperfections. Different topological phases of matter are characterized by topological invariants. In energy-conserving (Hermitian) systems, these invariants are determined by the winding of eigenstates in momentum space. In non-Hermitian systems, a topological invariant is predicted to emerge from the winding of the complex eigenenergies. Here, we directly measure the non-Hermitian topological invariant arising from exceptional points in the momentum-resolved spectrum of exciton polaritons. These are hybrid light-matter quasiparticles formed by photons strongly coupled to electron-hole pairs (excitons) in a halide perovskite semiconductor at room temperature. We experimentally map out both the real (energy) and imaginary (linewidth) parts of the spectrum near the exceptional points and extract the novel topological invariant—fractional spectral winding. Our work represents an essential step toward realization of non-Hermitian topological phases in a condensed matter system.}

     abstract = {Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide crystals (TMDCs) hold great promise for semiconductor optoelectronics because their bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) are stable at room temperature and interact strongly with light. When TMDCs are embedded in an optical microcavity, excitons can hybridise with cavity photons to form exciton polaritons, which inherit useful properties from their constituents. The ability to manipulate and trap polaritons on a microchip is critical for applications. Here, we create a non-trivial potential landscape for polaritons in monolayer WS2, and demonstrate their trapping and ballistic propagation across tens of micrometers. We show that the effects of dielectric disorder, which restrict the diffusion of WS2 excitons and broaden their spectral resonance, are dramatically reduced for polaritons, leading to motional narrowing and preserved partial coherence. Linewidth narrowing and coherence are further enhanced in the trap. Our results demonstrate the possibility of long-range dissipationless transport and efficient trapping of TMDC polaritons in ambient conditions.}

     abstract = {We investigate the effects of direct deposition of different dielectric materials (AlOx, SiOx, SiNx) onto atomically thin TMDC WS2 on its optical response using atomic layer deposition (ALD), electron beam evaporation (EBE), plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), and magnetron sputtering. The photoluminescence measurements reveal quenching of the excitonic emission after all deposition processes, which is linked to the increased level of charge doping and associated rise of the trion emission and/or the localized (bound) exciton emission. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy allows us to clearly correlate the observed changes in excitonic emission with the increased levels of lattice disorder and defects. In particular, we show that the different doping levels in a monolayer WS2 capped by a dielectric material are strongly related to the defects in the WS2 crystal introduced by all capping methods, except for ALD. The strong charge doping in the ALD-capped sample seems to be caused by other factors, such as deviations in the dielectric layer stoichiometry or chemical reactions on the monolayer surface, which makes ALD distinct from all other techniques. Overall, the EBE process results in the lowest level of doping and defect densities and in the largest spectral weight of the exciton emission in the PL. Sputtering is revealed as the most aggressive dielectric capping method for WS2, fully quenching its optical response. Our results demonstrate and quantify the effects of direct deposition of dielectric materials onto monolayer WS2, which can provide valuable guidance for the efforts to integrate monolayer TMDCs into functional optoelectronic devices.}

     abstract = {Topological insulators are a class of electronic materials exhibiting robust edge states immune to perturbations and disorder. This concept has been successfully adapted in photonics, where topologically nontrivial waveguides and topological lasers were developed. However, the exploration of topological properties in a given photonic system is limited to a fabricated sample, without the flexibility to reconfigure the structure in situ. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical realization of the orbital Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in a microcavity exciton-polariton system, whereby a cavity photon is hybridized with an exciton in a GaAs quantum well. We induce a zigzag potential for exciton polaritons all-optically by shaping the nonresonant laser excitation, and measure directly the eigenspectrum and topological edge states of a polariton lattice in a nonlinear regime of bosonic condensation. Furthermore, taking advantage of the tunability of the optically induced lattice, we modify the intersite tunneling to realize a topological phase transition to a trivial state. Our results open the way to study topological phase transitions on-demand in fully reconfigurable hybrid photonic systems that do not require sophisticated sample engineering.}

Some strategies have been developed, but they either rely on complicated experimental settings and expensive technologies or limit the achievable cavity quality factors. Thus, high quality Fabry-Pérot microcavities are not widely available to the community focusing on light-matter coupling in atomically thin materials. Here, we detail a recently developed technique to micro-mechanically assemble Fabry-Pérot microcavities. Our approach promotes strong coupling conditions with excitons in atomically thin materials, it does not rely on difficult or expensive technologies, it is reproducible, and it yields microcavities with quality factors approaching 4000. It is ideally suitable for engineering coupled monolayer-cavity systems of advanced complexity in small-scale laboratories.}

The speed of sound extracted from the dipole oscillation frequency is smaller than the Bogoliubov sound, which can be partly explained by the influence of the incoherent reservoir.

Integration of TMDCs into practical all-dielectric heterostructures hinges on the ability to passivate and protect them against necessary fabrication steps on large scales. Despite its limited scalability, encapsulation of TMDCs in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) currently has no viable alternative for achieving high performance of the final device. Here, we show that the novel, ultrathin $Ga_2O_3$ glass is an ideal centimeter-scale coating material that enhances optical performance of the monolayers and protects them against further material deposition. In particular, $Ga_2O_3$ capping of commercial grade $WS_2$ monolayers outperforms hBN in both scalability and optical performance at room temperature. These properties make $Ga_2O_3$ highly suitable for large scale passivation and protection of monolayer TMDCs in functional heterostructures.}

     abstract = {Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides are a promising platform to investigate many-body interactions of excitonic complexes. In monolayer tungsten diselenide, the ground-state exciton is dark (spin-indirect), and the valley degeneracy allows low-energy dark momentum-indirect excitons to form. Interactions between the dark exciton species and the optically accessible bright exciton (X) are likely to play significant roles in determining the optical properties of X at high power, as well as limiting the ultimate exciton densities that can be achieved, yet so far little is known about these interactions. Here, we demonstrate long-lived dense populations of momentum-indirect intervalley ($X_K) and spin-indirect intravalley (D) dark excitons by time-resolved photoluminescence measurements (Tr-PL). Our results uncover an efficient inter-state conversion between X to D excitons through the spin-flip process and the one between D and $X_K$ excitons mediated by the exchange interaction (D + D to $X_K$ + $X_K$). Moreover, we observe a persistent redshift of the X exciton due to strong excitonic screening by  $X_K$ exciton with a response time in the timescale of sub-ns, revealing a non-trivial inter-state exciton-exciton interaction. Our results provide a new insight into the interaction between bright and dark excitons, and point to a possibility to employ dark excitons for investigating exciton condensation and the valleytronics.}

     abstract = {Superfluidity, first discovered in liquid 4He, is closely related to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) phenomenon. However, even at zero temperature, a fraction of the quantum liquid is excited out of the condensate into higher momentum states via interaction-induced fluctuations—the phenomenon of quantum depletion. Quantum depletion of atomic BECs in thermal equilibrium is well understood theoretically but is difficult to measure. This measurement is even more challenging in driven-dissipative exciton-polariton condensates, since their non-equilibrium nature is predicted to suppress quantum depletion. Here, we observe quantum depletion of a high-density exciton-polariton condensate by detecting the spectral branch of elementary excitations populated by this process. Analysis of this excitation branch shows that quantum depletion of exciton-polariton condensates can closely follow or strongly deviate from the equilibrium Bogoliubov theory, depending on the exciton fraction in an exciton polariton. Our results reveal beyond mean-field effects of exciton-polariton interactions and call for a deeper understanding of the relationship between equilibrium and non-equilibrium BECs.}

     abstract = {Exciton-polaritons (polaritons herein) offer a unique nonlinear platform for studies of collective macroscopic quantum phenomena in a solid-state system. Shaping of polariton flow and polariton confinement via potential landscapes created by nonresonant optical pumping has gained considerable attention due to the flexibility and control enabled by optically induced potentials. Recently, large density-dependent energy shifts (blueshifts) exhibited by optically trapped polaritons at low densities, below the bosonic condensation threshold, were interpreted as an evidence of strong polariton-polariton interactions [Y. Sun et al., Nat. Phys. 13, 870 (2017), 10.1126/science.1074464]. In this work, we further investigate the origins of these blueshifts in optically induced circular traps and present evidence of significant blueshifts of the polariton energy due to reshaping of the optically induced potential with laser pump power. Our work demonstrates the strong influence of the effective potential formed by an optically injected excitonic reservoir on the energy blueshifts observed below and up to the polariton condensation threshold and suggests that the observed blueshifts arise due to interaction of polaritons with the excitonic reservoir, rather than due to polariton-polariton interaction.}

     abstract = {Bosonic condensates of exciton polaritons (light-matter quasiparticles in a semiconductor) provide a solid-state platform for studies of nonequilibrium quantum systems with a spontaneous macroscopic coherence. These driven, dissipative condensates typically coexist and interact with an incoherent reservoir, which undermines measurements of key parameters of the condensate. Here, we overcome this limitation by creating a high-density exciton-polariton condensate in an optically induced box trap. In this so-called Thomas-Fermi regime, the condensate is fully separated from the reservoir and its behavior is dominated by interparticle interactions. We use this regime to directly measure the polariton-polariton interaction strength, and reduce the existing uncertainty in its value from four orders of magnitude to within three times the theoretical prediction. The Thomas-Fermi regime has previously been demonstrated only in ultracold atomic gases in thermal equilibrium. In a nonequilibrium exciton-polariton system, this regime offers a novel opportunity to study interaction-driven effects unmasked by an incoherent reservoir.}

In analogy to spin chains, these vortex sequences realize either a "ferromagnetic" or an "antiferromagnetic" order, whereby the role of spin is played by the orbital angular momentum. The ferromagnetic ordering of vortices is associated with the formation of a persistent chiral current.

The structure is operated in the regime of collective strong coupling between a Tamm-plasmon resonance, GaAs quantum well excitons, and two-dimensional excitons confined in the monolayer crystal. Polariton condensation in a monolayer crystal manifests by a superlinear increase of emission intensity from the hybrid polariton mode, its density-dependent blueshift, and a dramatic collapse of the emission linewidth, a hallmark of temporal coherence. Importantly, we observe a significant spin-polarization in the injected polariton condensate, a fingerprint for spin-valley locking in monolayer excitons. Our results pave the way towards highly nonlinear, coherent valleytronic devices and light sources.}

     abstract = {We demonstrate the generation of chiral modes-vortex flows with fixed handedness in exciton-polariton quantum fluids. The chiral modes arise in the vicinity of exceptional points (non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies) in an optically induced resonator for exciton polaritons. In particular, a vortex is generated by driving two dipole modes of the non-Hermitian ring resonator into degeneracy. Transition through the exceptional point in the space of the system's parameters is enabled by precise manipulation of real and imaginary parts of the closed-wall potential forming the resonator. As the system is driven to the vicinity of the exceptional point, we observe the formation of a vortex state with a fixed orbital angular momentum (topological charge). This method can be extended to generate higher-order orbital angular momentum states through coalescence of multiple non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies. Our Letter demonstrates the possibility of exploiting nontrivial and counterintuitive properties of waves near exceptional points in macroscopic quantum systems.}

     abstract = {Diabolical points (spectral degeneracies) can naturally occur in spectra of two-dimensional quantum systems and classical wave resonators due to simple symmetries. Geometric Berry phase is associated with these spectral degeneracies. Here, we demonstrate a diabolical point and the corresponding Berry phase in the spectrum of hybrid light-matter quasiparticles—exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities. It is well known that sufficiently strong optical pumping can drive exciton-polaritons to quantum degeneracy, whereby they form a macroscopically populated quantum coherent state similar to a Bose-Einstein condensate. By pumping a microcavity with a spatially structured light beam, we create a two-dimensional quantum billiard for the exciton-polariton condensate and demonstrate a diabolical point in the spectrum of the billiard eigenstates. The fully reconfigurable geometry of the potential walls controlled by the optical pump enables a striking experimental visualization of the Berry phase associated with the diabolical point. The Berry phase is observed and measured by direct imaging of the macroscopic exciton-polariton probability densities.}

     abstract = {We demonstrate, experimentally and theoretically, a Talbot effect for hybrid light-matter waves—an exciton-polariton condensate formed in a semiconductor microcavity with embedded quantum wells. The characteristic "Talbot carpet" is produced by loading the exciton-polariton condensate into a microstructured one-dimensional periodic array of mesa traps, which creates an array of phase-locked sources for coherent polariton flow in the plane of the quantum wells. The spatial distribution of the Talbot fringes outside the mesas mimics the near-field diffraction of a monochromatic wave on a periodic amplitude and phase grating with the grating period comparable to the wavelength. Despite the lossy nature of the polariton system, the Talbot pattern persists for distances exceeding the size of the mesas by an order of magnitude. Thus, our experiment demonstrates efficient shaping of the two-dimensional flow of coherent exciton polaritons by a one-dimensional "flat lens."}

Utilizing momentum resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we observe a transition between an incoherent Bose gas and a polariton condensate, which undergoes further transitions between different energy states in the band-gap spectrum of the periodic potential with increasing pumping power. We demonstrate controlled loading into distinct energy bands by modifying the size and shape of the excitation beam. The observed effects are comprehensively described in the framework of a nonequilibrium model of polariton condensation. In particular, we implement a stochastic treatment of quantum and thermal fluctuations in the system and conclude that polariton-phonon scattering is a plausible energy relaxation mechanism enabling transitions from the highly nonequilibrium polariton condensate in the gap to the ground band condensation for large pump powers.}

     abstract = {Exciton-polaritons are hybrid light-matter quasiparticles formed by strongly interacting photons and excitons (electron-hole pairs) in semiconductor microcavities. They have emerged as a robust solid-state platform for next-generation optoelectronic applications as well as for fundamental studies of quantum many-body physics. Importantly, exciton-polaritons are a profoundly open (that is, non-Hermitian) quantum system, which requires constant pumping of energy and continuously decays, releasing coherent radiation. Thus, the exciton-polaritons always exist in a balanced potential landscape of gain and loss. However, the inherent non-Hermitian nature of this potential has so far been largely ignored in exciton-polariton physics. Here we demonstrate that non-Hermiticity dramatically modifies the structure of modes and spectral degeneracies in exciton-polariton systems, and, therefore, will affect their quantum transport, localization and dynamical properties. Using a spatially structured optical pump, we create a chaotic exciton-polariton billiard--a two-dimensional area enclosed by a curved potential barrier. Eigenmodes of this billiard exhibit multiple non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies, known as exceptional points. Such points can cause remarkable wave phenomena, such as unidirectional transport, anomalous lasing/absorption and chiral modes. By varying parameters of the billiard, we observe crossing and anti-crossing of energy levels and reveal the non-trivial topological modal structure exclusive to non-Hermitian systems. We also observe mode switching and a topological Berry phase for a parameter loop encircling the exceptional point. Our findings pave the way to studies of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics of exciton-polaritons, which may uncover novel operating principles for polariton-based devices.}

     abstract = {A bosonic condensate of exciton polaritons in a semiconductor microcavity is a macroscopic quantum state subject to pumping and decay. The fundamental nature of this driven-dissipative condensate is still under debate. Here, we gain an insight into spontaneous condensation by imaging long-lifetime exciton polaritons in a high-quality inorganic microcavity in a single-shot optical excitation regime, without averaging over multiple condensate realisations. We demonstrate that condensation is strongly influenced by an incoherent reservoir and that the reservoir depletion, the so-called spatial hole burning, is critical for the transition to the ground state. Condensates of photon-like polaritons exhibit strong shot-to-shot fluctuations and density filamentation due to the effective self-focusing associated with the reservoir depletion. In contrast, condensates of exciton-like polaritons display smoother spatial density distributions and are second-order coherent. Our observations show that the single-shot measurements offer a unique opportunity to study fundamental properties of non-equilibrium condensation in the presence of a reservoir.}
